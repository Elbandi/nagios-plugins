This file documents the major additions and syntax changes between releases.

1.4.11 13th December 2007
	Fix check_http regression in 1.4.10 where following redirects to
	  relative URLs on virtual hosts failed if both "-H" and "-I" were used
	check_ntp now return UNKNOWN instead of WARNING if jitter is unavailable (jitter=-1.000000)
	  as long as the thresholds range inculde -1. If no offset threshold is specified
	  and the offset is unavailable, will return UNKNOWN as well.
	  NOTE: If jitter thresholds are specified as integers it will return CRITICAL if jitter
	  is "-1" as the default range starts at 0. See Examples in --help output.
	Fix broken usage2 in check_snmp and check_cluster
	check_cluster now accept all valid characters in its thresholds ("-", "@", "~")
	Merge two new checks that deprecates check_ntp: check_ntp_peer and check_ntp_time.
	  You should read the --help output so see which one is suitable for you. check_ntp_peer
	  implement stratum thresholds support (feature request #1703823).
	Fix check_disk reporting OK if disk usage grows over 100% (bug #1348746).
	  The problem happens to be in Gnulib but a workaround have been implemented in check_disk.c
	Fix check_load argument handling when not passing triplets (bug #1831890)
	Tinderbox builds now run tests in a verbose mode
	Update to Nagios::Plugin 0.22
	VPATH problem fixed for compiling plugins-root

1.4.10 28th September 2007
	Fix check_http buffer overflow vulnerability when following HTTP redirects
	check_http now explicitly asks HTTP/1.1 servers to close the connection
	  after completion of the response
	Check_ldaps' guessing which secure method to use (starttls vs. ssl on connect)
	  is now deprecated. See --help for further information.
	Check_disk now calls stat() on all filesystems to check. (Old: only the ones selected using -p)
	  A meaningful error message (eg "Stale NFS Handle") is printed if stat fails.
	New check_disk option -L: Only check local filesystems, but call stat() on remote ones, too.
	  Thus accessibility of remote filesystems can be checked without any threshold comparison.
	Check_disk's --help now prints some examples for the new features introduced in 1.4.8
	New check_disk -i/-I option to ignore pathes/partitions based on regular expressions
	New check_disk -A option to select all filesystems explicitly
	WARNING: check_disk's -E option must now be passed before -p or -r/-R arguments
	  Passing -E after -p or -r results in UNKNOWN state, now
	  This is needed due to the new ignore feature
	Fix check_disk bug when mixing case sensitive and case insensitive regex arguments
	New check_dhcp -u/--unicast option for emulating a DHCP relay in order
	  to check DHCP servers on remote networks
	New check_dhcp -m/--mac option which allows for specifying the MAC
	  address to use in the DHCP request
	The check_dhcp -r and -s options now accept host names, too
	Fix possible check_icmp bus errors on some (non-x86/AMD64) platforms
	Fix check_smtp's handling of multiple-packet server responses
	WARNING: Fix for negate which may break existing commands:
	  - stop evaluating command line options through shell twice
	  - enforce a full path for the command to run
	The "negate" utility can now remap custom states
	Check_radius now supports radiusclient-ng
	The (undocumented) positional parameter parsing which check_radius used
	  instead of getopt(3) if 8 arguments were given is no longer available
	Check_by_ssh now supports multiline output
	IPv6 support can now be disabled using ./configure --without-ipv6
	Fix check_ntp now honor ntp flags

1.4.9 4th June 2006

	New/improved -E/--skip-stderr and -S/--skip-stdout options for check_by_ssh
	check_snmp now supports Counter64
	Fix compilation of check_ldap, check_radius and check_pgsql

	check_udp2 removed. check_udp is now linked to check_tcp.c

	  as if mailqs were okay when the nagios user could not query the mail-queues
