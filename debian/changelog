  * upstream includes fix for warn/crit handling in check_tcp based plugins
    such as check_simap (closes: #351847).
  * dpkg's conffile handling can't deal with migrating config files

nagios-plugins (1.4.3.0cvs.20060707-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [sean finney]
  * new release based on latest upstream CVS HEAD, as backporting some
    of the changes would involve either massive patches to the autofoo
    generated files (Makefile/Configure etc) or by changing the packages
    to autogenerate the autofoo stuff as part of the build process,
    neither of which i like.
  * anyway, the goodies:
    - upstream incorporated fix for F'ing TBFS due to the broken .la files
      installed in the libradius-dev package
    - new check_apt plugin to check that a host is up to date wrt the debian
      package management system (run with --help for more information)
      Closes: #317763.
    - new check_ntp plugin written in C, which performs much faster and more
      reliably than the perl plugin, and does everything natively
      (sending/recieving the packets itself instead of parsing the output
      of ntpdate/ntpq). Closes: #351257, #360549, #360774.
    - as a result, we no longer need to depend on any of the NTP stuff.
  * modified debian/control to reflect new lack of dependency on ntp
  * modified debian/rules to keep check_ntp in the -basic package, as
    there's no reason to keep it in standard now.
  * finally incorporate martin pitt's request about transitioning to
    the new postgres build system.  Closes: #377201.

  [marc haber]
  * make package build fail if /proc is not mounted, before I end up
    filing that bug a fourth time. Closes: #344389, #354215

  * new upstream release.

  [sean finney]
  * the following dpatches have been incorporated upstream and thus removed:
    - 11_check_ups.c_perfdata_fix.dpatch
    - 12_check_mysql.c_mysql_options.dpatch
    - 15_check_mrtg_wtf_conditionals.dpatch
    - 16_check_smtp_protocolfix.dpatch
    - 17_check_smb_freespace.dpatch
    - 19_check_disk_subdirs.dpatch
    - 20_check_ntp_lessbeastlyregex.dpatch
    - 21_de.po_fixes.dpatch
    - 24_check_procs_localefix.dpatch
  * the following dpatches have been modified to still apply against upstream
    - 10_config.h_debiandefaults.dpatch
    - 14_check_log_paths.dpatch
    - 18_check_game_cmdline.dpatch
  * removed the transitional (pre-sarge) fileutils dependency 
    (closes: #368718), thanks to Stefan Huehner for pointing this out.
  * upstream now uses libtool, but the shipped libtool is out of date and
    has problems building against radiusclient1-dev (which might not be
    our fault, but...).  so, for the time being we're shipping an updated
    version of ltmain.sh in the diff (build depending on the newest version
    of libtool is subobtimal for backporting).
  * add --disable-rpath to configure options... arg, and i had to apply
    another patch to ./configure to keep a -R from sneaking in and
    deactivating it.
  * upstream ./configure fails to automagically detect mysql installation now,
    so modify debian/rules accordingly.
  * modify debian/control to be more explicit about build-dependencies to
    make life easier for backporting.

nagios-plugins (1.4.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  [sean finney]
  * 10_config.h_debiandefaults.dpatch now also hardcodes nslookup,
    removing the need for a couple more build-dependencies (dnsutils,
    bind9-host | host).  this also has the added benefit that the
    build process doesn't require a working dns setup :)
  * moved check_dig to -standard, as that's where check_dns (and
    more importantly its configs and dependencies) are.
  * moved check_ping to -basic.  even though it means another
    dependency in -basic, maintainer consensus is that it's
    critical enough of a plugin that it should go in.
  * split config for check_fping into fping.cfg.

  [marc haber]
  * migrate package from CVS to svn
  * add 23_check_axis.dpatch, making the package suiteable to
    debian/-only layout
  * convert to debian/-only layout
  * add build-dependency on autotools-dev, add code to automatically
    link in current config.guess, config.sub

nagios-plugins (1.4.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sean Finney
    - add documentation to README.Debian about the plugins needing setuid
      root, why we don't install them setuid root by default, and some
      recommended methods for dealing with this (closes: #289879).
    - add documentation to README.Debian about the new package split.
    - config.h_debiandefaults.dpatch now modifies common.h instead of
      config.h.in, because the latter would sometimes cause build hosts
      to spontaneously regenerate the file, overwriting our changes.
      since all the plugins include common.h too... (closes: #336639).
    - include some patches from "F.A.G. Luteijn" <f.a.g.luteijn@knoware.nl>:
      * dhcp.cfg (with notes added by me about needing setuid)
      * disk.cfg (check_all_disks)
      * disk-smb.cfg (seperated check_disk_smb commands)
      * http.cfg (check_https_auth)
      * check_disk_smb: allow checking disk usage via host addresses.

nagios-plugins (1.4.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sean Finney:
    - only depend on ntp, not ntp | ntp-simple.  hopefully this should
      allow nagios-plugins to co-exist with openntpd et al.
    - now building against libmysqlclient14-dev.
    - updated Standards-Version to 3.6.2
    - nagios-plugins is now separated into 3 separate packages:
      nagios-plugins, nagios-plugins-basic, and nagios-plugins-standard.
      this should provide folks with a "basic" set of plugins as an
      alternative to those who don't want to bring in so many dependencies
      (specifically, users of nsca and nagios-nrpe-server).  the original
      package will depend on both of the new packages, for backwards
      compatibility.  the list of what-goes-where may change in future
      updates, but nagios-plugins will always bring in everything.
      contact me if you have specific preferences on how the layout should
      be done (closes: #303996, #264194, #255438).
    - another fix to check_mrtg, seems like the WARN and CRIT states
      were working just fine, but there was no way for things to
      be OK.  whoops.  thanks to uno takeshi for looking into this.
      (closes: #335871).
    - updated FSF address, couple other cosmetic lintian-related fixes.

    - looks like upstream's check_mrtg has been broken for a while now.
      now including a fix that i'll eventually move upstream.
      (closes: #309673).
    - include a fix to check_smtp to make it speak proper ehlo before
      issueing a starttls command, and also check that the server
      actually supports it before blindly continuing.  thanks to
      Jeroen van Wolffelaar for taking the time to point out the
      details (closes: #285554).
    - in the process of the above, also figured out how to get
      check_smtp to play nicely with gnutls-based servers.
    - check_disk once again will match non-mountpoint directories to
      the closest parent mountpoint (closes: #296278).
    - include jeroen's "less beastly" check_ntp sys.peer regex.
    - fix for braindead command-line option parsing for freespace
      in check_disk_smb (closes: #300701).
    - updated the usage function in check_game to reflect changed
      cmdline options (closes: #307905).
    - upstream is now shipping an non-broken ipv6-capable check_ping, 
      with PING6_COMMAND properly set in config.h (closes: #309255).
    - upstream check_mysql can now check slave status (closes: #278864).

  * New upstream release.
  * Sean Finney:
    - now managing nagios-plugins as part of the pkg-nagios alioth project.
    - updated Maintainer field
    - updated build-dependencies to build against libsnmp9-dev
    - removed build-dependencies on exim4 | mail-transport-agent, ssh, fping,
      qstat, smbclient, and ntp stuff.  instead they are all have their
      paths hardcoded into the build-process via dpatch file
      10_config.h_debiandefaults.dpatch (closes: #312333, #297708).
    - added config option for ssmtp
    - upstream is now accidentally deleting the check_ldaps plugin
      during the build-process.  whoops.
    - removed unneccesary dpatch 09_pssyntax, massaged 08_subst.dpatch
      into shape with new upstream version.
    - added check_mysql_cmdlinecred to allow parsing of credentials on
      the cmdline (closes: #314913).
    - looks like the issue with check_load was previously resolved by
      guido (closes: #305351).
    - nagios and nagios-plugins no longer need to use update-nagios, as nagios
      can natively scan /etc/nagios-plugins/config now:
      (closes: #325893, #321939).
    - i believe check_ldap's config is now correct (closes: #305720).
    - removed references to check_nmap, which is generally superceded
      by check_tcp.  it still exists in the contrib directory of the
      source, which may at some point be put in /usr/share/doc for those
      who really want it (closes: #319997).
    - include de.po patch from jens seidel (closes: #313960).
    - upstream fix: all of the plugins should now be properly setting
      locales, so problems like commas for decimal seperators should no
      longer break plugins for people in certain locales:
      (closes #312228, #306244, #308458, #327212, #316882).

    lintian not complain...

    definitions already shipped with nagios. Thanks to Nate Allen 
    who found out the solution. (closes: #232300)

nagios-plugins (1.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

    is not so terrible
