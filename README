Nagios Plugins README
---------------------

* For instructions on installing these plugins for use with Nagios,
  see below. In addition, generic instructions for the GNU toolchain
  can be found in the INSTALL file.

* For major changes between releases, read the NEWS file.

* For information on detailed changes that have been made or plugins 
  that have been added, read the Changelog file.

* Some plugins require that you have additional programs and/or
  libraries installed on your system before they can be used.  Plugins
  that are dependent on other programs/libraries that are missing are
  usually not compiled. Read the REQUIREMENTS file for more information.

* For a list of outstanding bugs for this release, see the BUGS file.

* Individual plugins are self documenting.  All plugins that comply with
  the basic guidelines for development will provide detailed help when
  invoked with the '-h' or '--help' options.

* The file command.cfg contains example configurations for many of the
  plugins

* The win32 subdir contains plugins specific to the Win32 platform. 
  These are scripts or binaries.

Nagios Plugins Quick-and-Dirty Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------

0) If you are using the CVS tree, you will need m4, gettext, automake, and autoconf. 
   To start out, run ./tools/setup

   For more detail, see the developer guidelines at 
   http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/developer-guidelines.html.


1) Run the configure script to initialize variables and create a Makefile, etc.

	./configure --prefix=BASEDIRECTORY --with-cgiurl=SOMEURL

   a) Replace BASEDIRECTORY with the path of the directory under which Nagios
      is installed (default is '/usr/local/nagios')
   b) Replace CGIURL with the path used to access the Nagios CGIs with
      a web browser (default is '/nagios/cgi-bin')


2) Compile the plugins with the following command:

	make


3) Install the compiled plugins and plugin scripts with the following command:

	make install

   The installation procedure will attempt to place the plugins in a 
   'libexec/' subdirectory in the base directory you specified with
   the --prefix argument to the configure script.

4) There are some plugins that require setuid. If you run make install as 
   a non root user, they will not be installed. To install, switch to root and 
   run:

	make install-root

5) Verify that your host configuration file (hosts.cfg) for Nagios contains
   the correct paths to the new plugins.



That's it! If you have any problems or questions, feel free send mail
to nagiosplug-help@lists.sourceforge.net
